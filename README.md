## Redset
Redset is a dataset containing three months worth of user query metadata that
ran on a selected sample of instances in the Amazon Redshift fleet. We provide
query metadata for 200 provisioned and serverless instances each.

## Schema
| Column | Name	Description	|
| ------ | ---------------- |
| instance_id |	Uniquely identifies a redshift cluster |
| cluster_size | Size of the cluster (only available for provisioned) |
| user_id |	Identifies the user that issued the query |
| database_id |	Identifies the database that was queried |
| query_id | Unique per instance |
| arrival_timestamp | Timestamp when the query arrived on the system |
| compile_duration_ms |	Time the query spent compiling in milliseconds |
| queue_duration_ms | Time the query spent queueing in milliseconds |
| execution_duration_ms | Time the query spent executing in milliseconds |
| feature_fingerprint |	Hash value of the query fingerprint. A proxy for query-likeness, though not based on text. Will overestimate repetition. |
| was_aborted |	Whether the query was aborted during its lifetime |
| was_cached | Whether the query was answered from result cache |
| cache_source_query_id | If query was answered from result cache, this is the query id for the query which populated the cache |
| query_type | Type of query, e.g.., `select`, `copy`, ... |
| num_permanent_tables_accessed | Number of permanent table accesses by the query (regular database table) |
| num_external_tables_accessed | Number of [external tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.html) accessed by the query |
| num_system_tables_accessed | Number of [system tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm_chap_system-tables.html) accessed by the query |
| read_table_ids | Comma separated list of unique permanent table ids read by the query |
| write_table_ids |	Comma separated list of unique table ids written to by the query |
| mbytes_scanned | Total number of megabytes scanned by the query |
| mbytes_spilled | Total number of megabytes spilled by the query |
| num_joins | Number of joins in the query plan |
| num_scans | Number of scans in the query plan |
| num_aggregations | Number of aggregations in the query plan |
